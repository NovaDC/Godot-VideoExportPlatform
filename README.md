# Godot-VideoExportPlatform

A simple Godot EditorExportPlatformExtension that provides a interface for video rendering in the editor's export menu.

Requires the [NovaTools](https://github.com/NovaDC/Godot-Novatools "NovaTools Github Repository") plugin as a dependency. Compatable with all MovieWriter addons.

The icon for this plugin is unmodified and used [directly from the Godot Editor](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/editor/icons/Animation.svg "Link to the original icon as hosted on Github") wherever possible. It is used under the Godot game engine's [MIT licence](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
